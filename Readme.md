Señor Staff

Señor Staff is a music composition app for Mac OS X. It features a staff-based interface (rather than a tracker interface) for natural entry and readability, and supports playback to any MIDI device. Emphasis is placed on user efficiency and automated enforcement of musical constraints.


TODO - I need your help. 

OSXApp folder - reference code
Contains historic osx app + code base. - Non ARC. 
The models have ui logic / classes. This predates ios operating system.

SimpleApp - no ui
I've refactored the  models to use ARC and midi parser is succesfully loading notes + rests + measures + staffs
